# Business_Case_OLA_Ensemble_Learning

1. Introduction
   
❓ What is OLA - Ensemble Learning Business Case?
● Ola is a leading ride-sharing platform, aiming to provide reliable, affordable, and convenient urban transportation for everyone.
● The constant challenge Ola faces is the churn rate of its drivers. Ensuring driver loyalty and reducing attrition are crucial to the company's
operation.
● Analyzing driver data can reveal patterns in driver behavior, performance, and satisfaction. This would help in foreseeing potential churn,
allowing proactive measures.
● By leveraging data science and ensemble learning, Ola can predict driver churn, which would be pivotal in its driver retention strategy.

🎯 Objective:

● Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for
drivers to stop working for the service on the y or jump to Uber depending on the rates.
● As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To nd new drivers, Ola is casting a wide net, including people
who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and
acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.
● You are working as a data scientist with the Analytics Department of Ola, focused on driver team attrition. You are provided with the
monthly information for a segment of drivers for 2019 and 2020 and tasked to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not
based on their attributes like
Demographics (city, age, gender etc.)
Tenure information (joining date, Last Date)
Historical data regarding the performance of the driver (Quarterly rating, Monthly business acquired, grade, Income)
